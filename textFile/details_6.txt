Laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of dengue include 1 or more of the following:
1.Isolation of the dengue virus from serum, plasma, leukocytes, or autopsy samples.

2.Demonstration of a fourfold or greater change in reciprocal immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgM antibody titers to 1 or more dengue virus antigens in paired serum samples.

3.Demonstration of dengue virus antigen in autopsy tissue via immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence or in serum samples via enzyme immunoassay (EIA).

4.Detection of viral genomic sequences in autopsy tissue, serum, or cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) samples via polymerase chain reaction (PCRI assay.

The following laboratory tests should also be performed in the workup of patients with possible dengue:
1.Complete blood count (CBC).

2.Metabolic panel.

3.Serum protein and albumin levels.

4.Liver panel.

5.Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) panel.


Characteristic findings in dengue fever are as follows:
1.Thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100 x 109/21.

2.Leukopenia

3.Mild to moderate elevation of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase values.


In patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever, the following may be present:
1.Increased hematocrit level secondary to plasma extravasation and/or third-space fluid loss.

2.Hypoproteinemia.

3.Prolonged prothrombin time.

4.Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time.

5.Decreased fibrinogen.

6.Increased amount of fibrin split products.

7.Guaiac testing for occult blood in the stool should be performed on all patients in whom dengue virus infection is suspected. Urinalysis identifies hematuria.


Imaging studies:
1.Chest radiography.

2.Head computed tomography (CT) scanning without contrast: To detect intracranial bleeding or cerebral edema from dengue hemorrhagic fever.

3.Ultrasonography. To detect fluid in the chest and abdominal cavities, pericardial effusion, and a thickened gallbladder wall, in dengue hemorrhagic fever.
