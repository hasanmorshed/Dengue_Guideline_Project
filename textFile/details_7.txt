Dengue is a virus, so there is no specific treatment or cure. However, there are things a patient or doctor can do to help. depending on the severity of the disease. For milder forms of dengue fever the treatment methods are:

Prevent dehydration:
High fever and vomiting can dehydrate the body. Make sure to drink clean lideally bottled water rather than tap water. Rehydration salts can also help replace fluids and minerals.

Painkillers:
This can help lower fever and ease pain. As some NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), such as aspirin or ibuprofen can increase the risk of internal bleeding, patients are advised to use Tylenol (paracetamol) instead.

Get plenty of rest:
You should start to feel better in around a week, although it may be a few weeks before you feel your normal self again. Get medical advice if your symptoms don't improve.

The following treatment options are designed for the more severe forms of dengue fever:
Intravenous fluid supplementation (IV drip):-
In some cases of dengue the patient is unable to take fluids vrally and will need to receive an IV drip.

Blood transfusion:
A blood transfusion may be recommended for patients with severe dehydration.

Hospital care:
It is important to be treated by doctors, this way the individual can be properly monitored in case symptoms worsen.
